# HR Contract and Documentation Management Web Application

This is a repository for my bachelor's final project, which is a Web Application focus on HR department needs. I'm trying to create a tool capable of managing the personal documentation of employees.

## the idea
I used to work in a big factory in Juarez, Mexico, by developing some small software projects to HR department. Large, heavy and dusty shelves full of documents were the decoration of the place. It was hard to find a single document of certain employee. So I came up with a simple idea: why don't we upload all this information and documents to the cloud?. They had a software infrastructure for handling certain information... but not for all that paper.
## Based on Angular and GCP service's 
It'll be build by using Angular on the frontend and Google Cloud Platform service's on the backend.
